#            a public data set made available on the Chicago Data Portal.

# Methodology
# 1. Avoiding the use of the `table.number` parameter
# 2. keep the 'geography' and 'estimate' data frames within each acs object
# 3. keep only the census tracts from the acs data frame
#    that appear in the master.census.tract.community.area.crosswalk.df

# Name:           Hardship Index
# Description:    The hardship index is a score that incorporates each of the six selected socioeconomic indicators according to the method described in An Update on Urban Hardship 
#                 (see footnote 2 on page 53 of http://www.rockinst.org/pdf/cities_and_neighborhoods/2004-08-an_update_on_urban_hardship.pdf). 
#                 Scores on the index can range from 1 to 100, with a higher index number representing a greater level of hardship. 
#                 The scores are standardized according to the data for the 77 community areas, 
#                 and therefore cannot be compared to scores generated for other jurisdictions.
# Recreation:     Please see the UIC Chicago Community Area report on the Hardship Index
#                 to learn more about how this function was recreated.
#                 https://greatcities.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/GCI-Hardship-Index-Fact-SheetV2.pdf

## Prior to calculating the Hardship Index
## I must create a data frame that contains 78 rows and 9 columns
# Row order: One for each community area (77) + one for the entire City
# Column order:
# 1. CCA number
# 2. CCA name
# 3. % housing crowded
# 4. % households living below the federal poverty level
# 5. % aged 16+ who are unemployed
# 6. % aged 25+ without a high school diploma
# 7. % aged under 18 or over 64
# 8. Per capita income
# 9. Hardship Index
